==================================
RGMA feature-precipitation product
==================================

Data under folder named by years

- Masks of 4 features ("AR", "MCS", "LPS", "Front") identified by individual algorithms.
  6-hourly, 0.25-deg on ERA-5 grids. 
  These data are derived from origional ouputs archived on NERSC Perlmutter. 

- "MERGE-IR"
  brightness temperature which is used to differentiate deep convection and congestus from 
  unexplained precipitating pixels.

- "MERGED-FP"
  The final products that contain feature masks and GPM precipitation:

  "GPM_feature_merged_xx.nc": regridded GPM precipitation, feature binary masks
  "FeatureOverlap_indicator_map_xx.nc": PIDs (from 1 to 16), deep convection binary mask, congestus
                                        binary mask
